### TODO
- [firebase] /twitter, /github links
-- Doesnt work since `sapper export` doesnt know how to handle.
-- Might require firebase redirect for this.
-- If `goto` can handle external urls, this can be handled client side
- [firebase] 404
-- Firebase requires 404.html which can be 404.svelte
-- But for `sapper export` to work, it needs to be linked somewhere
